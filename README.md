# Welcome to betblock
This is the React frontend application for betblock. This application is built using Material UI package and threejs. Animations are Lottie files that have been color-palette-adopted for our application.
You can run some basic commands to start it and to build production environment.
```
yarn start
yarn build
```

React Router is used to navigate through the application and we manually split between betblock.fi and app.betblock.fi

These builds are deployed on AWS EC2 instances.

Viem is used to interact with smart contracts and anything web3-related.

All the branding has been built by us - One nifty note is that the colors on the betblock logo are blends of Chainlink, Polygon, and Avalanche colors!
