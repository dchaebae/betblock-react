# Welcome to betblock
This is the React frontend application for betblock. This application is built using material UI package and threejs. Animations are Lottie files that have been color-palette-adopted for our application.
You can run some basic commands to start it and to build production environment.
```
yarn start
yarn build
```

React Router is used to navigate through the application and we manually split between betblock.fi and app.betblock.fi

These builds are deployed on AWS EC2 instances.
